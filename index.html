      <h2>Multimodal Assessment and the Politics of Potential</h2>
      <p>It took me one semester to realize I loved teaching. By the end of the same semester, I decided that I also hated grading. </p>
      <p>When I began teaching five years ago, I sat down with several wonderful mentors to discuss the realities of teaching in higher education. While they talked frankly about the demands of the role, none were able to truly prepare me for what assessment would <em>feel</em> like. I couldn’t have predicted the weight of it, of having 400 pages of student writing on my to-do list. I couldn’t have expected the literal dread that would fill my body as I tried to decipher what was an “A” versus a “B”, while knowing that the difference had genuine stakes for a student. And, in the age of AI, I had no concept for the burden of policing student writing for anything falsely generated. Any grade or feedback I gave students could be the motivation for them to improve in their writing, yes. But it could also be the difference between them getting a scholarship, acceptance to a graduate program, or retaining their current housing. That weight and guilt mixed with an even more complicated feeling; I care about my students and genuinely find their writing exciting. I <em>want</em> to witness their improvements, to be proud of their growth, to be surprised by them, to laugh out loud, cry, and think differently about the world through and with them. But even so, I dreaded due dates with fervor. </p>
      <p>For a while, I didn’t interrogate this dislike. It served as a common language amongst other teachers. A colleague passing by in the hall murmuring, “I’ve got to go grade forty papers” became a moment of shared misery, like someone had said they had to take their pet to the emergency vet or their child had brough home norovirus from preschool. <em>Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry,</em> I’d say. <em>Keep your head up. It’ll be over soon.</em></p>
      <p>In my refusal to examine this dread, I made the mistake of equating all assessment with grading. I avoided professional development opportunities surrounding assessment in lieu of other topics. I avoided reading about assessment– it became a word that my eyes just skimmed over in texts. I rarely changed anything about my grading or assessment practices even though I knew it was a key part of my role as an instructor. Every semester I improved in my teaching, but this was an area I quickly grew stagnant. Despite my avoidance, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I knew I needed to be better for my students, especially as I sought to build classes centered around social justice topics and pedagogies. My avoidance of assessment, of course, was not just a personal issue, but a political one. </p>
      <p>A breakthrough moment came while reading Stacey Waite’s <em>Teaching Queer: Possibilities for Writing, Reading, and Knowing</em>(2017), when Waite writes, “In reading student writing, I often take from Lad Tobin that ‘from the moment I started reading drafts for potential rather than for assessment, my relationship to my students and my sense of self as a writing teacher changed in fundamental and exhilarating ways;” (159). The word <em>potential</em> became something I couldn’t shake. What does it actually mean to read student work for potential? And could potential, in contrast to the quote above, become a part of equitable assessment rather than an alternative to it? The word “potential” is broadly defined as “possible as opposed to actual” or “having or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future”. To explore something through the lens of potential is to assess it not just as it is, but as it could be–as a moving and changing object, with moves and changes that are entirely attainable. In science, “potential” describes a fundamental property of matter: its capacity to have attributes that are only manifested or released under specific conditions. Potential energy, for example, is about the energy stored within an object or body, already there and waiting to be released when certain conditions are met. This resonates with the idea of assessment as being something both generative and aspirational (Katz and Odell, 2012). Potential is not about some idealistic, unattainable future goal that is out of reach. It is about striving towards something more, while also involving what we currently already “have”, if only the right conditions are met to manifest the current work and knowledge into something greater. </p>
      <p>This lens of potential quickly became not just a way of escaping the fixed nature of certain assessment measures, but also a means of revising my approaches to assessment in the first place. Thus began my three-year process of coming to know assessment – not in the limiting ways I had initially thought of it, but as expansive and vital to equitable and ethical teaching. Using case studies of three courses I taught during the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024, I explore my evolution of assessment through the lens of potential. I specifically explore how multimodal projects and multimodal assessment influenced the changes I have made broadly to my assessment practices. In this discussion, I draw on scholarship in Critical Disability Studies to contextualize how justice-oriented assessment practices are particularly necessary for cultivating potential. Throughout my discussion, I utilize the multimodal genres featured in my case studies as a way of exploring my evolution of assessment through the modes that began the evolution in the first place.</p>

      <h3><em>Positionality</em></h3>
      <p>The following video explores my current positionality as an early-stage scholar, and what "assessment" generally means to me. I utilized a multimodal format to emphasize the uniqueness of multimodal work and the insights it can give.</p>

      <h3><em>Cripping Assessment</em></h3>
      <p> In “Teaching is Accommodation,” Anne-Marie Womack (2017) frames accessibility as “the precondition to all learning”. Every aspect of teaching, assessment included, is predicated on the reality that for anyone to learn, they must first be able to access the space where learning is occurring, the materials mediating the learning, and the relationships and feedback mechanisms that enable them to participate and engage fully. Despite this reality, conversations surrounding disability and accommodations are often framed in terms of individual deficits on the part of the student. Brueggemann et al’s (2001) question comes to mind here: “Why is it that someone who learns to read in the fourth grade is a ‘slow learner’ and not just ‘someone who learned to read in the 4th grade’?” Ableist frameworks of learning are often ones of rehabilitation based on assessed failures; as teachers, we must reform the “slow learner.” We must speed them up, make them more like the “normal” students, get their writing on track with their peers. If we cannot do this, then that student will fail and/or be relegated to a different space. And it becomes all too easy to blame the student: they weren’t ready for college, they didn’t put enough effort in, they didn’t ask for enough help. </p>
      <p>While Universal Design approaches to learning emphasize flexibility, communication, and adaptation, accommodations for students tend to be rigid, shallow attempts to “fix” what have been deemed as deficits. When encountering barriers for access, disabled individuals are then expected to justify the need to remove those barriers, a violent burden that is rarely a straightforward process (Titchkosky, 2008). And even when disabled individuals can point to aspects of academic environments that are hindering their participation and they are believed – which is often not the case – they are then expected to guess what they might need (Dolmage, 2017). Disabled students, staff, and faculty often then must settle for less than what they actually need because their accommodations are deemed “too expensive” or “not necessary enough” (Price, 2024). If accessibility is the precondition to all learning, the most common approaches to it – minimal, cost-driven, and reactive – fails the majority of people in academia.</p>
      <p>This sort of scarcity-driven approach to accessibility reflects broader institutional logics, ones that also frame how student learning is measured and reported. These narrowed definitions are built around racialized and ableist frameworks that systematically exclude students whose ways of knowing, expressing, or learning fall outside dominant norms. Disability justice movements have long studied and challenged these frameworks, and crip activists in particular have emphasized in contrast the contributions that disabled individuals and communities have on society. "Crip” is a term that has been reclaimed by its pejorative past, though it still serves as a way to make people “wince” and to jolt them out of their disability expectations (Kafer, 2013). To “crip” something invokes a lineage of self-identified crip activists – those smashing inaccessible curbs with hammers, chaining wheelchairs together to block busy intersections, and demanding better services and treatment for all people (McCruer, 2008). It is a term that invites friction, urges people to be unsettled, and demands more from disabled and able-bodied people. To theorize from a crip standpoint is to lead from the position of those excluded from the design and creation and a space, those whose “failure” to access it reveals not their own deficits, but the space’s own limitations. </p>
      <p>So what would it mean to “crip” assessment? Neera Jain notes that a crip approach destabilizes assessment completely; it calls on fields to reconsider what exclusionary perspectives have shaped their discipline’s beliefs about learning, what ought to be assessed in the first place, and the methods measurement itself. A crip approach is not just about expanding understandings of quality, ability, and learning, but about going back to the source of their dominant definitions and breaking down their exclusionary beginnings (Jain, 2022). Cripping assessment, then, doesn’t begin with assessment at all, but with the very beginnings of a course: it’s learning goals, design, materials, and space. In the case studies and discussion in this chapter, I specifically explore how cripping assessment calls on educators to center their initial design and feedback in a way that prioritizes the potential of students. I consider how assessments shift if we were to begin every course, unit, and project with questions like: <em>How and why do learners struggle to perform (or fail) on current assessments? How would these assessments shift if we assumed that these students - disabled or otherwise - could be successful learners?</em>(Jain, 2022). If certain students’ tendencies to fail becomes a starting point to consider the flaws of assessment, then their potential to succeed and learn becomes an indicator for how to make those changes.</p>

      <h3><em>Towards New Modes of Assessment</em></h3>
      <p> Disabled students and educators have long pointed to multimodality as being essential to building more accessible spaces of learning. While multimodality – in terms of materials, projects, and assessment methods – does not automatically make learning more accessible, the more modes a person has access to learn and create in, the more flexibility they have to accommodate their learning and creation styles (Brueggemann et al, 2001). Multimodal assessment also helps instructors shift away from traditional, static grading methods and moves them into commenting on works in more expansive ways, placing value and attention on aspects like creativity, technique, and the knowledges built from the interplay of different modalities (Wierszewski, 2013). Traditional methods of grading often work by “freezing” student writing and learning, creating a fixed value on what has been deemed a finished project (Hout, 2002). Multimodality has the potential to resist this static view of learning, both through the modes a student creates in and through the modes an instructor uses to assess the work. </p>
      <p>Like the conversations of disability and accessibility above, multimodality is central to my evolution with assessment. When I first began teaching, I enjoyed the process of teaching multimodal projects, but found myself frustrated during the grading process. There were so many modes to take into consideration when providing feedback, not to mention that the interplay between modes also created even more rhetorical layers to assess. I found myself giving students A’s much more readily in these projects, partially because I didn’t know how to critically evaluate such different modes, but also because I was genuinely impressed with the work that students were turning in. Unlike traditional print essays, students were experts in many of the multimodal genres and mediums that they created in. How, I wondered, could I take off points, when the projects were better than I could create in that unfamiliar medium? But even asking that question began to bother me, my focus on justifying the “points” I took off rather than the feedback I could give to strengthen the work. This discomfort surrounding multimodal assessment became a turning point in my relationship to assessment broadly, as I was forced to reckon with the fact that there is not some secret method that would “fix” my difficulties with assessing multimodal work. Rather, it was my limiting view of assessment in general that was the overarching problem. </p>
      <p>The evolution of my approaches to assessment were gradual and remains a work in progress. Over the past few years, as I’ve tried (and sometimes failed!) to integrate new methods and justice-oriented frameworks, I’ve found value in reading accounts of educators putting their principles directly into practice. The case studies that follow contribute that that growing body of work. They center around multimodal projects that students conducted in a series of summer courses I taught in 2022, 2023, and 2024, in which I detail exactly what I changed and the results of those shifts. I conclude by discussing how my experiences shape my current approach to assessment in undergraduate courses. </p>

      <h3><em>Case Studies</em></h3>
      <p>For the past five years, I have taught English courses each summer for high school students in the University of Kansas’ Upward Bound program. Upward Bound is a federally-funded program that provides support for low-income and first-generation high school students to increase the rates at which they attend and complete a higher education degree. In the 2024-2025 school year, Upward Bound funded over 1,000 programs across the U.S., reaching over 70,000 low-income, first-generation, and academically-at-risk high schoolers (Upward Bound, 2025). For students in the program, Upward Bound offers resources throughout the school year such as tutoring, counseling, mentoring, cultural enrichment activities, and economic opportunities. They also offer a summer program that allows students to earn a stipend while taking summer classes in English, Math, Science, and Language courses. These summer bridge classes are meant to both support the learning students will do in their remaining high school classes and help prepare them for collegiate level courses. </p>
        <p>As an English teacher for Upward Bound, I have control over the content, topics, instruction, and assessment for the courses I teach, as long as I can justify how the class is growing students’ writing, reading, and communication skills. Because of this course design freedom, I tend to try out new activities, projects, course topics, and assessment methods during the summer. The following three courses were designed and taught by me for between twenty to thirty students each summer.</p>

      <h4>Summer 2022 - Zinemaking in the Composition Classroom</h4>
      <p>Zines are handmade, self-published booklets that circulate in small quantities throughout communities. Though most scholars trace their roots back to 1930s science fiction culture, zines quickly expanded to cover activism and politics, fan communities, teaching and learning, and self-reflection and representation (Duncombe, 1996). Because of their variability and lower cost to make and print, zines have also become a valuable tool for engaging students in the writing classroom and connecting their work more directly with public audiences. Their countercultural history also makes them a powerful multimodal genre for marginalized groups (Bold, 2005; Homna, 2016), and scholars have noted the benefits of specifically engaging youth in zinemaking (Poletti, 2005; Yang, 2010). Because the majority of my students were multiply-marginalized, I saw zines as an avenue for engaging them in developing multimodal composition skills while also exploring their interests, identities, and activist responses to issues that they encounter in their daily lives.</p>
      <iframe src='https://simplebooklet.com/embed.php?wpKey=3qA4728k5AbjSBS3NPLUUU&source=embed' allowfullscreen width='100%' height='650' style='border: 0; overflow: hidden; width: 1px; min-width: 100%; max-width:1012px;' scrolling='no'></iframe>
     <p>In this course, students first learned about the history of zinemaking and spend time observing and analyzing previously published zines. They were then tasked with creating two zines of their own. The first was a personal storytelling zine in which students created a booklet that showcased some aspect of their personality, interests, or identities. Students created zines on their favorite movies, books, and video games, on fashion, their zodiac signs, their families and pets, struggles they face in their lives, and their cultures. I printed copies of their zines so that they could trade with each other, give some to other teachers and classmates, and share with their family and friends. After making their first zine, students reflected in depth about the process, analyzing their rhetorical choices and assessing what worked well or could use improvements. They then used these reflections to help them develop their second zine. </p>
      <p>The second zine students made in the class asked them to combine storytelling and research to inform a chosen audience about a public issue of their choice. Students created zines on reproductive rights, gun violence, beauty standards, climate change, mental health, and more. The examples below showcase some of the covers of student zines.</p>

     <p>One student, Anjalique, made the following zine about the Black Lives Matter movement and the pain and brutality of racism.</p>
    <iframe src='https://simplebooklet.com/embed.php?wpKey=Z1mgQTO0nTcNkxDT82Cxaj&source=embed' allowfullscreen width='100%' height='650' style='border: 0; overflow: hidden; width: 1px; min-width: 100%; max-width:1012px;' scrolling='no'></iframe>

    <p>I had taught multimodal projects before, but nothing as comprehensive as the projects in this course. As I designed the class, I was forced for the first time to consider the way that multimodal composition challenges the way instructors approach assignments. Rather than just having a multimodal project tacked on at the end of a semester, multimodal work formed the foundation of this course and was consistent throughout. Students did complete other smaller projects in conjunction with the zines, but the majority of their efforts were centered around this multimodal work. And while I have been teaching long enough to know that students will often surprise me in wonderful ways, I could not have prepared myself for the incredible work students did for these projects. My amazement and excitement and awe at their work forced me to confront my assessment strategies. How, after all, could I reduce the important work students were doing here to a series of letter grades and post-design comments about their rhetorical choices? How could I possibly read works like Anjalique’s above and simply assign a letter grade to it? </p>
    <p>So I didn’t! Instead, I formed my assessment of the multimodal projects around the labor students did. Inspired by Inoue’s labor-based grading contracts, I created a series of labor-focused questions that determined each student’s grade for the project. For each project, I asked:</p>
    <p><em>Did the student complete a full 8-page zine with something on each page? </em></p>
    <p><em>Did the student turn their zine on time or within a requested extension time? </em></p>
    <p><em>Did the student work the entire workshop on their zines? If they did not, did they talk with me about why they could or could not work the whole time?</em></p>
    <p><em>Did the student work without distracting classmates from their own projects?</em></p>
    <p>If the answer was “yes” to these questions, students received full points, an “A” in the gradebook. If the answer was “no” to any of the questions, students dropped to a “B”, “C”, and so forth. Looking back, I would probably amend these questions to include more of the labor they did throughout the process (something like “Did the student implement all or the majority of feedback discussed in their one-on-one conference with me during the drafting stage?”), but for my first time switching to a labor-based system I kept it simple, and I don’t regret that. The questions above also don’t fully reflect the assessment work I was doing in class as they drafted their zines; I met with them each one-on-one multiple times and gave oral and written feedback on their designs. While it is always difficult to switch to a new assessment style, my changes here were immediately telling. Many students switched topics once they learned I was grading based on labor rather than the finished design, most switching from topics they had deemed “easier” or more likely to get them an A to ones that they actually wanted to try to make.</p>
    <p>In addition to using a labor-based framework for assessment, I also assessed student progress throughout the course with daily journals and reflection essays. These reflective-based writings helped students assess their own work in addition to providing consistent avenues for me to evaluate their learning. Their first zine reflection, for example, asked students to identify their zine’s strengths and weaknesses, justify why they made the rhetorical choices they did, and talk about what they would change about their process going forward. These assignments, too, were graded based on labor and completion rather than on any aspects of writing mechanics.</p>
    <p>Yes, most students ended with an A in the class. In fact, I don’t think there was a single student who received lower than an A on any of their zines. But I intentionally chose in this class to place value on the labor of designing multimodal, public works and the commitment to showing up to class and trying their best. In a higher-level course, I would design the labor-based assessment criteria with more rigorous expectations, but for my first time experimenting with new assessment methods, I focused on trying something new and seeing how it impacted my students and my view of their learning. And the differences were noticeable. Whether their growth was exponential or just a few steps forwards, I found that valuing the labor of learning helped students feel more comfortable in new genres, take risks, and worry less about their grade and more about engaging and making what they genuinely wanted the world to see. The process itself forced a big change in my assessment practices; rather than beginning with a traditional assessment method and using it to assess every project, I began each project by interrogating my learning goals for students and tracking how my assessment reflected what I wanted to place value on in terms of student learning.</p>

      <h4>Summer 2023 - Disability Rhetorics</h4>
      <p>In my course on disability rhetorics, students began by delving into conversations surrounding disability, accessibility, accommodations, and ableism. We watched the documentary <em>Crip Camp</em> and read chapters from Alice Wong’s <em>Disability Visibility</em>, both of which students reflected on in journal writing and class discussion. The major assignment for the course, though, was centered around a collaborative accessibility audit and audit report which was sent to the University of Kansas Accessibility Office.</p>
      <p>For the project, students across three courses conducted accessibility audits of varying parts of our building including classrooms, hallways, elevators, entrances and exits, and bathrooms. Each student completed their own audit checklist with around fifty questions to evaluate the accessibility of the building's spaces, but they completed the audit together. Each class determined what they wanted that collaboration to be like. One class went through the entire building together. One class split into two groups and each took a different floor. The final class broke into partners and assigned each group of partners to a specific area of the building to complete the audit for and then report back. Each class double-checked each other’s work and shared information with each other throughout the entirety of the audit. </p>
      <p>After conducting the audit, the students across all three classes collaborated to write their audit report for the campus Accessibility Office. We brainstormed the different roles we would need for writing up the report and then the students decided which roles they would take on based on their interests and strengths as a writer and researcher. My class of seniors then took the work of the previous classes and revised it into one final report which was approved by everyone before we emailed it to the Accessibility Office. </p>
      <p>Like the zine class from the summer before, I assessed student learning throughout the course of the semester through daily journals, individual meetings with students, and reflection worksheets. Also like the zine class, I focused my graded assessment on the labor students did throughout the process of the audit, but “labor” grew more complicated this semester as the work of the project was intentionally not equal. Every student did a different amount of work, with some students willingly taking on larger research and writing roles. We had candid conversations during class about how learning is not tied to being able to do the most work in a class, but that you contribute to your learning in a way that is sustainable and meaningful for you. This framework of labor importantly corresponded with the disability scholars and activists we were learning about in class, along with critiques of traditional labor-based methods that failed to take into account how normative expectations of labor disadvantaged disabled, neurodivergent, and chronically ill students (Inoue, 2023; Carillo, 2021). </p>
      <p>In addition to the discussions of labor in the class, I also added peer assessment as a feature of the major class assignment. This project was incredibly collaborative, and I wanted to give students a space to talk about that collaboration and how it contributed to or detracted from their learning experiences. Genuinely surprising to me, not a single student complained about the group work or their peers (if you have ever taught group work you know this is a literal miracle), and most students used the peer assessment space to shout out other group members for going about and beyond in certain situations. The worksheet below is an example of what I assessed for a project like this:</p>
