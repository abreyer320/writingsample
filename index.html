      <h2>Multimodal Assessment and the Politics of Potential</h2>
      <p>It took me one semester to realize I loved teaching. By the end of the same semester, I decided that I also hated grading. </p>
      <p>When I began teaching five years ago, I sat down with several wonderful mentors to discuss the realities of teaching in higher education. While they talked frankly about the demands of the role, none were able to truly prepare me for what assessment would <em>feel</em> like. I couldn’t have predicted the weight of it, of having 400 pages of student writing on my to-do list. I couldn’t have expected the literal dread that would fill my body as I tried to decipher what was an “A” versus a “B”, while knowing that the difference had genuine stakes for a student. And, in the age of AI, I had no concept for the burden of policing student writing for anything falsely generated. Any grade or feedback I gave students could be the motivation for them to improve in their writing, yes. But it could also be the difference between them getting a scholarship, acceptance to a graduate program, or retaining their current housing. That weight and guilt mixed with an even more complicated feeling; I care about my students and genuinely find their writing exciting. I <em>want</em> to witness their improvements, to be proud of their growth, to be surprised by them, to laugh out loud, cry, and think differently about the world through and with them. But even so, I dreaded due dates with fervor. </p>
      <p>For a while, I didn’t interrogate this dislike. It served as a common language amongst other teachers. A colleague passing by in the hall murmuring, “I’ve got to go grade forty papers” became a moment of shared misery, like someone had said they had to take their pet to the emergency vet or their child had brough home norovirus from preschool. <em>Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry,</em> I’d say. <em>Keep your head up. It’ll be over soon.</em></p>
      <p>In my refusal to examine this dread, I made the mistake of equating all assessment with grading. I avoided professional development opportunities surrounding assessment in lieu of other topics. I avoided reading about assessment– it became a word that my eyes just skimmed over in texts. I rarely changed anything about my grading or assessment practices even though I knew it was a key part of my role as an instructor. Every semester I improved in my teaching, but this was an area I quickly grew stagnant. Despite my avoidance, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I knew I needed to be better for my students, especially as I sought to build classes centered around social justice topics and pedagogies. My avoidance of assessment, of course, was not just a personal issue, but a political one. </p>
      <p>A breakthrough moment came while reading Stacey Waite’s <em>Teaching Queer: Possibilities for Writing, Reading, and Knowing</em>(2017), when Waite writes, “In reading student writing, I often take from Lad Tobin that ‘from the moment I started reading drafts for potential rather than for assessment, my relationship to my students and my sense of self as a writing teacher changed in fundamental and exhilarating ways;” (159). The word <em>potential</em> became something I couldn’t shake. What does it actually mean to read student work for potential? And could potential, in contrast to the quote above, become a part of equitable assessment rather than an alternative to it? The word “potential” is broadly defined as “possible as opposed to actual” or “having or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future”. To explore something through the lens of potential is to assess it not just as it is, but as it could be–as a moving and changing object, with moves and changes that are entirely attainable. In science, “potential” describes a fundamental property of matter: its capacity to have attributes that are only manifested or released under specific conditions. Potential energy, for example, is about the energy stored within an object or body, already there and waiting to be released when certain conditions are met. This resonates with the idea of assessment as being something both generative and aspirational (Katz and Odell, 2012). Potential is not about some idealistic, unattainable future goal that is out of reach. It is about striving towards something more, while also involving what we currently already “have”, if only the right conditions are met to manifest the current work and knowledge into something greater. </p>
      <p>This lens of potential quickly became not just a way of escaping the fixed nature of certain assessment measures, but also a means of revising my approaches to assessment in the first place. Thus began my three-year process of coming to know assessment – not in the limiting ways I had initially thought of it, but as expansive and vital to equitable and ethical teaching. Using case studies of three courses I taught during the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024, I explore my evolution of assessment through the lens of potential. I specifically explore how multimodal projects and multimodal assessment influenced the changes I have made broadly to my assessment practices. In this discussion, I draw on scholarship in Critical Disability Studies to contextualize how justice-oriented assessment practices are particularly necessary for cultivating potential. Throughout my discussion, I utilize the multimodal genres featured in my case studies as a way of exploring my evolution of assessment through the modes that began the evolution in the first place.</p>

      <h3><em>Positionality</em></h3>
      <p>The following video explores my current positionality as an early-stage scholar, and what "assessment" generally means to me. I utilized a multimodal format to emphasize the uniqueness of multimodal work and the insights it can give.</p>

      <h3><em>Cripping Assessment</em></h3>
      <p> In “Teaching is Accommodation,” Anne-Marie Womack (2017) frames accessibility as “the precondition to all learning”. Every aspect of teaching, assessment included, is predicated on the reality that for anyone to learn, they must first be able to access the space where learning is occurring, the materials mediating the learning, and the relationships and feedback mechanisms that enable them to participate and engage fully. Despite this reality, conversations surrounding disability and accommodations are often framed in terms of individual deficits on the part of the student. Brueggemann et al’s (2001) question comes to mind here: “Why is it that someone who learns to read in the fourth grade is a ‘slow learner’ and not just ‘someone who learned to read in the 4th grade’?” Ableist frameworks of learning are often ones of rehabilitation based on assessed failures; as teachers, we must reform the “slow learner.” We must speed them up, make them more like the “normal” students, get their writing on track with their peers. If we cannot do this, then that student will fail and/or be relegated to a different space. And it becomes all too easy to blame the student: they weren’t ready for college, they didn’t put enough effort in, they didn’t ask for enough help. </p>
      <p>While Universal Design approaches to learning emphasize flexibility, communication, and adaptation, accommodations for students tend to be rigid, shallow attempts to “fix” what have been deemed as deficits. When encountering barriers for access, disabled individuals are then expected to justify the need to remove those barriers, a violent burden that is rarely a straightforward process (Titchkosky, 2008). And even when disabled individuals can point to aspects of academic environments that are hindering their participation and they are believed – which is often not the case – they are then expected to guess what they might need (Dolmage, 2017). Disabled students, staff, and faculty often then must settle for less than what they actually need because their accommodations are deemed “too expensive” or “not necessary enough” (Price, 2024). If accessibility is the precondition to all learning, the most common approaches to it – minimal, cost-driven, and reactive – fails the majority of people in academia.</p>
      <p>This sort of scarcity-driven approach to accessibility reflects broader institutional logics, ones that also frame how student learning is measured and reported. These narrowed definitions are built around racialized and ableist frameworks that systematically exclude students whose ways of knowing, expressing, or learning fall outside dominant norms. Disability justice movements have long studied and challenged these frameworks, and crip activists in particular have emphasized in contrast the contributions that disabled individuals and communities have on society. "Crip” is a term that has been reclaimed by its pejorative past, though it still serves as a way to make people “wince” and to jolt them out of their disability expectations (Kafer, 2013). To “crip” something invokes a lineage of self-identified crip activists – those smashing inaccessible curbs with hammers, chaining wheelchairs together to block busy intersections, and demanding better services and treatment for all people (McCruer, 2008). It is a term that invites friction, urges people to be unsettled, and demands more from disabled and able-bodied people. To theorize from a crip standpoint is to lead from the position of those excluded from the design and creation and a space, those whose “failure” to access it reveals not their own deficits, but the space’s own limitations. </p>
      <p>So what would it mean to “crip” assessment? Neera Jain notes that a crip approach destabilizes assessment completely; it calls on fields to reconsider what exclusionary perspectives have shaped their discipline’s beliefs about learning, what ought to be assessed in the first place, and the methods measurement itself. A crip approach is not just about expanding understandings of quality, ability, and learning, but about going back to the source of their dominant definitions and breaking down their exclusionary beginnings (Jain, 2022). Cripping assessment, then, doesn’t begin with assessment at all, but with the very beginnings of a course: it’s learning goals, design, materials, and space. In the case studies and discussion in this chapter, I specifically explore how cripping assessment calls on educators to center their initial design and feedback in a way that prioritizes the potential of students. I consider how assessments shift if we were to begin every course, unit, and project with questions like: <em>How and why do learners struggle to perform (or fail) on current assessments? How would these assessments shift if we assumed that these students - disabled or otherwise - could be successful learners?</em>(Jain, 2022). If certain students’ tendencies to fail becomes a starting point to consider the flaws of assessment, then their potential to succeed and learn becomes an indicator for how to make those changes.</p>

      <h3><em>Towards New Modes of Assessment</em></h3>
      <p> Disabled students and educators have long pointed to multimodality as being essential to building more accessible spaces of learning. While multimodality – in terms of materials, projects, and assessment methods – does not automatically make learning more accessible, the more modes a person has access to learn and create in, the more flexibility they have to accommodate their learning and creation styles (Brueggemann et al, 2001). Multimodal assessment also helps instructors shift away from traditional, static grading methods and moves them into commenting on works in more expansive ways, placing value and attention on aspects like creativity, technique, and the knowledges built from the interplay of different modalities (Wierszewski, 2013). Traditional methods of grading often work by “freezing” student writing and learning, creating a fixed value on what has been deemed a finished project (Hout, 2002). Multimodality has the potential to resist this static view of learning, both through the modes a student creates in and through the modes an instructor uses to assess the work. </p>
      <p>Like the conversations of disability and accessibility above, multimodality is central to my evolution with assessment. When I first began teaching, I enjoyed the process of teaching multimodal projects, but found myself frustrated during the grading process. There were so many modes to take into consideration when providing feedback, not to mention that the interplay between modes also created even more rhetorical layers to assess. I found myself giving students A’s much more readily in these projects, partially because I didn’t know how to critically evaluate such different modes, but also because I was genuinely impressed with the work that students were turning in. Unlike traditional print essays, students were experts in many of the multimodal genres and mediums that they created in. How, I wondered, could I take off points, when the projects were better than I could create in that unfamiliar medium? But even asking that question began to bother me, my focus on justifying the “points” I took off rather than the feedback I could give to strengthen the work. This discomfort surrounding multimodal assessment became a turning point in my relationship to assessment broadly, as I was forced to reckon with the fact that there is not some secret method that would “fix” my difficulties with assessing multimodal work. Rather, it was my limiting view of assessment in general that was the overarching problem. </p>
      <p>The evolution of my approaches to assessment were gradual and remains a work in progress. Over the past few years, as I’ve tried (and sometimes failed!) to integrate new methods and justice-oriented frameworks, I’ve found value in reading accounts of educators putting their principles directly into practice. The case studies that follow contribute that that growing body of work. They center around multimodal projects that students conducted in a series of summer courses I taught in 2022, 2023, and 2024, in which I detail exactly what I changed and the results of those shifts. I conclude by discussing how my experiences shape my current approach to assessment in undergraduate courses. </p>

      <h3><em>Case Studies</em></h3>
      <p>For the past five years, I have taught English courses each summer for high school students in the University of Kansas’ Upward Bound program. Upward Bound is a federally-funded program that provides support for low-income and first-generation high school students to increase the rates at which they attend and complete a higher education degree. In the 2024-2025 school year, Upward Bound funded over 1,000 programs across the U.S., reaching over 70,000 low-income, first-generation, and academically-at-risk high schoolers (Upward Bound, 2025). For students in the program, Upward Bound offers resources throughout the school year such as tutoring, counseling, mentoring, cultural enrichment activities, and economic opportunities. They also offer a summer program that allows students to earn a stipend while taking summer classes in English, Math, Science, and Language courses. These summer bridge classes are meant to both support the learning students will do in their remaining high school classes and help prepare them for collegiate level courses. </p>
        <p>As an English teacher for Upward Bound, I have control over the content, topics, instruction, and assessment for the courses I teach, as long as I can justify how the class is growing students’ writing, reading, and communication skills. Because of this course design freedom, I tend to try out new activities, projects, course topics, and assessment methods during the summer. The following three courses were designed and taught by me for between twenty to thirty students each summer.</p>

      <h4>Summer 2022 - Zinemaking in the Composition Classroom</h4>
      <p>Zines are handmade, self-published booklets that circulate in small quantities throughout communities. Though most scholars trace their roots back to 1930s science fiction culture, zines quickly expanded to cover activism and politics, fan communities, teaching and learning, and self-reflection and representation (Duncombe, 1996). Because of their variability and lower cost to make and print, zines have also become a valuable tool for engaging students in the writing classroom and connecting their work more directly with public audiences. Their countercultural history also makes them a powerful multimodal genre for marginalized groups (Bold, 2005; Homna, 2016), and scholars have noted the benefits of specifically engaging youth in zinemaking (Poletti, 2005; Yang, 2010). Because the majority of my students were multiply-marginalized, I saw zines as an avenue for engaging them in developing multimodal composition skills while also exploring their interests, identities, and activist responses to issues that they encounter in their daily lives.</p>
      <iframe src='https://simplebooklet.com/embed.php?wpKey=3qA4728k5AbjSBS3NPLUUU&source=embed' allowfullscreen width='100%' height='650' style='border: 0; overflow: hidden; width: 1px; min-width: 100%; max-width:1012px;' scrolling='no'></iframe>
     <p>In this course, students first learned about the history of zinemaking and spend time observing and analyzing previously published zines. They were then tasked with creating two zines of their own. The first was a personal storytelling zine in which students created a booklet that showcased some aspect of their personality, interests, or identities. Students created zines on their favorite movies, books, and video games, on fashion, their zodiac signs, their families and pets, struggles they face in their lives, and their cultures. I printed copies of their zines so that they could trade with each other, give some to other teachers and classmates, and share with their family and friends. After making their first zine, students reflected in depth about the process, analyzing their rhetorical choices and assessing what worked well or could use improvements. They then used these reflections to help them develop their second zine. </p>
      <p>The second zine students made in the class asked them to combine storytelling and research to inform a chosen audience about a public issue of their choice. Students created zines on reproductive rights, gun violence, beauty standards, climate change, mental health, and more. The examples below showcase some of the covers of student zines.</p>
