      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>The following writing sample will be featured in the collection, Made Not Only in Grades: Multimodal Assessment in the Social Justice Turn, with editors Gavin P. Johnson, Ashanka Kumari, and Shane A. Wood. My chapter has already been reviewed by the editors and accepted for publication and is currently in the process of a secondary review phase. </p>

      <h2>Multimodal Assessment and the Politics of Potential</h2>
      <p>It took me one semester to realize I loved teaching. By the end of the same semester, I decided that I also hated grading. </p>
      <p>When I began teaching five years ago, I sat down with several wonderful mentors to discuss the realities of teaching in higher education. While they talked frankly about the demands of the role, none were able to truly prepare me for what assessment would feel like. I couldn’t have predicted the weight of it, of having 400 pages of student writing on my to-do list. I couldn’t have expected the literal dread that would fill my body as I tried to decipher what was an “A” versus a “B”, while knowing that the difference had genuine stakes for a student. And, in the age of AI, I had no concept for the burden of policing student writing for anything falsely generated. Any grade or feedback I gave students could be the motivation for them to improve in their writing, yes. But it could also be the difference between them getting a scholarship, acceptance to a graduate program, or retaining their current housing. That weight and guilt mixed with an even more complicated feeling; I care about my students and genuinely find their writing exciting. I want to witness their improvements, to be proud of their growth, to be surprised by them, to laugh out loud, cry, and think differently about the world through and with them. But even so, I dreaded due dates with fervor. </p>
      <p>For a while, I didn’t interrogate this dislike. It served as a common language amongst other teachers. A colleague passing by in the hall murmuring, “I’ve got to go grade forty papers” became a moment of shared misery, like someone had said they had to take their pet to the emergency vet or their child had brough home norovirus from preschool. <em>Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry,</em> I’d say. <em>Keep your head up. It’ll be over soon.</em></p>
      <p>In my refusal to examine this dread, I made the mistake of equating all assessment with grading. I avoided professional development opportunities surrounding assessment in lieu of other topics. I avoided reading about assessment– it became a word that my eyes just skimmed over in texts. I rarely changed anything about my grading or assessment practices even though I knew it was a key part of my role as an instructor. Every semester I improved in my teaching, but this was an area I quickly grew stagnant. Despite my avoidance, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I knew I needed to be better for my students, especially as I sought to build classes centered around social justice topics and pedagogies. My avoidance of assessment, of course, was not just a personal issue, but a political one. </p>
      <p>A breakthrough moment came while reading Stacey Waite’s <em>Teaching Queer: Possibilities for Writing, Reading, and Knowing</em>(2017), when Waite writes, “In reading student writing, I often take from Lad Tobin that ‘from the moment I started reading drafts for potential rather than for assessment, my relationship to my students and my sense of self as a writing teacher changed in fundamental and exhilarating ways;” (159). I word <em>potential</em> became something I couldn’t shake. What does it actually mean to read student work for potential? And could potential, in contrast to the quote above, become a part of equitable assessment rather than an alternative to it? The word “potential” is broadly defined as “possible as opposed to actual” or “having or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future”. To explore something through the lens of potential is to assess it not just as it is, but as it could be–as a moving and changing object, with moves and changes that are entirely attainable. In science, “potential” describes a fundamental property of matter: its capacity to have attributes that are only manifested or released under specific conditions. Potential energy, for example, is about the energy stored within an object or body, already there and waiting to be released when certain conditions are met. This resonates with the idea of assessment as being something both generative and aspirational (Katz and Odell, 2012). Potential is about striving towards something more, while also involving what we currently already “have”, if only the right conditions are met to manifest the current work and knowledge into something greater.</p>
      <p>This lens of potential quickly became not just a way of escaping the fixed nature of certain assessment measures, but also a means of revising my approaches to assessment in the first place. Thus began my three-year process of coming to know assessment – not in the limiting ways I had initially thought of it, but as expansive and vital to equitable and ethical teaching. Using case studies of three courses I taught during the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024, I explore my evolution of assessment through the lens of potential. I specifically explore how multimodal projects and multimodal assessment influenced the changes I have made broadly to my assessment practices. In this discussion, I draw on scholarship in Critical Disability Studies to contextualize how justice-oriented assessment practices are particularly necessary for cultivating potential. Throughout my discussion, I utilize the multimodal genres featured in my case studies as a way of exploring my evolution of assessment through the modes that began the evolution in the first place.</p>
